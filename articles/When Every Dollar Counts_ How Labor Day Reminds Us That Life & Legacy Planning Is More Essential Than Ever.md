When Every Dollar Counts: How Labor Day Reminds Us That Life & Legacy Planning Is More Essential Than Ever

Labor Day has always been about honoring the American worker—the people who build our communities, power our economy, and create the foundation of our society. But this year, as we fire up our grills and enjoy that long weekend, there's an elephant in the room that deserves our attention.

For millions of working families, every dollar has become precious in a way it hasn't been for decades. While we celebrate labor, the reality is that the fruits of that labor aren't stretching as far as they used to.

Let’s explore why the current economic squeeze actually makes protecting your hard-earned money more important than ever before. We'll consider specific data showing how much basic necessities have increased, why this makes estate planning crucial rather than optional, and how Life & Legacy Planning can ensure every dollar you've worked for reaches the people you love—instead of being lost to legal complications and unnecessary fees.

# The Numbers Are Staggering
The data tell a stark story that affects people where it hurts most - the essential costs of daily life. According to the , from 2020 to 2024, food prices rose 23.6 percent—higher than the overall inflation rate of 21.2 percent. Transportation costs skyrocketed even more, jumping 34.4 percent, while housing costs climbed 23.0 percent. For renters,  and have risen 1.5 times faster than wages since 2019. Meanwhile,  face mortgage rates that jumped from below 3% during COVID to a peak of 7.08% in October of 2024, more than doubling borrowing costs (as of publication, rates are about 6.6%). And if you need a car? , with the average payment now at a record $742 per month.

Furthermore, with the implementation of new U.S. tariff rates,  that consumer prices have increased in the short run and are expected to continue the pattern in the long run. 
This isn't about statistics—it's about real families making real sacrifices. Parents skipping meals so their kids can eat. Young adults are moving back home because rent is unaffordable. Retirees are returning to work because their savings aren't enough anymore.

So what does this economic reality mean for protecting your family's future?


# Why Life & Legacy Planning is More Critical, Not Less
Here's what might surprise you: this economic squeeze makes Life & Legacy Planning more crucial, not less.

When money is tight, it's natural to think estate planning is a luxury you can't afford. That thinking couldn't be more wrong. In fact, it could cost your loved ones everything you’ve worked for and keep them from being able to use their inheritance to build a stable financial future for themselves.

When resources are already stretched thin, your family simply cannot afford the chaos that comes from not having a plan. Without proper planning, your assets could get stuck in probate court for months or years while your loved ones can't access money for basic living expenses, medical bills, or keeping the family home. Court fees and administrative expenses can easily consume 5-10% of an estate's value and sometimes more. For a family already struggling financially, losing thousands to unnecessary legal fees can be devastating.

The beauty of proper Life & Legacy Planning is that it works regardless of your economic circumstances. In fact, the less financial cushion you have, the more important it becomes to ensure every dollar reaches the people you love.

When you work with me to create your comprehensive Life & Legacy Plan, I can help you ensure that your loved ones have immediate access to resources when they need them—no waiting months for probate courts or scrambling to pay the estate’s bills out of pocket while assets are tied up. Together, we’ll use smart planning strategies to help your dollars go further- whether through trusts that protect assets from creditors, structures that preserve government benefits, or life insurance proceeds that grow over time rather than becoming a one-time payout. Moreover, a comprehensive Life & Legacy Plan adapts as your circumstances change over time, ensuring that it works when your loved ones need it to.

But what happens to families who don't have this protection in place? Let’s consider a hypothetical scenario that illustrates the specific impact your loved ones could face.

# The Real Cost to Your Loved Ones
Consider this: Maria worked two jobs to support her three children after her divorce. Between her administrative work and weekend grocery shifts, she was barely keeping afloat even before inflation hit hard. She was in survival mode, working hard to support herself and her children each day. Estate planning felt like a luxury she couldn't afford, both in terms of time and money. 

But Maria did have assets to protect: a small life insurance policy, a modest retirement account, and emergency savings. More importantly, she had three minor children who would need care both physically and financially if she died before they became adults.

Maria ended up dying in a tragic car accident, at which point her family discovered the harsh reality of not having a plan. Her life insurance got tied up because she'd never updated beneficiary designations after her divorce—it still listed her disappeared ex-husband. Her children ended up in temporary foster care because family members couldn’t afford to raise them and their own kids at the same time.

By the time the legal dust settled eighteen months later, attorney fees and court costs had consumed nearly 40% of what Maria had worked so hard to save. Her children inherited a mess instead of their mother's gift of financial stability.

Now consider this: If Maria had worked with me to create a Life & Legacy Plan, not only would we have created a plan that saved her assets for her children rather than going towards court costs, but I would have also helped her review her beneficiary designations for her accounts, further protecting those assets for her kids. Her children would not have ended up in foster care because I would have advised her on how to provide financial support so her chosen guardians had the financial resources to raise her children. And, because I have systems in place to make the planning process easy and efficient, I would have helped her get her planning done even though she was busy working two jobs and raising three children.

It appears that the economic challenges we're facing aren't going away soon. But by working with me to create your Life & Legacy Plan, you can ensure that today's financial pressures don't compound into tomorrow's devastating problems.
