How to Keep Wealth in Your Family for Generations
Many families focus on building wealth, but fewer think about keeping it.  that a majority of wealthy families lose their wealth by the second generation, and by the third generation, the number climbs as high as 90%. That happens not because parents lack concern for their kids, but because key pieces of planning are missing.
Keeping wealth in your family isn’t just about signing legal documents or having a strong investment portfolio. True wealth preservation requires a shift in how you think about inheritance, practical systems that keep your assets accessible, and education that prepares the next generation to be responsible stewards.
In this article, you’ll learn three essential elements of building and preserving generational wealth: the mindset shifts that redefine what inheritance really means, the legal and financial strategies that keep assets from slipping through the cracks, and the education process that prepares your children to manage and grow what you’ve worked so hard to build. Most importantly, you’ll see why families who succeed in passing wealth down think differently about what they’re actually leaving behind.
# The Mindset Shift: From “My Wealth” to “Our Legacy”
The families who successfully maintain prosperity over multiple generations understand something critical: wealth is more than money. Yes, you can leave your children a million dollars, but if they don’t understand responsibility, financial management, or your family’s values, that money will vanish.
Generational wealth lasts when you pass on both tangible and intangible assets, not only accounts and property, but also the knowledge, traditions, and life lessons that make financial wealth sustainable. Your experiences, values, and even your failures are part of the inheritance that will shape how your children handle what you leave them.
This requires a mindset shift: inheritance isn’t a one-time transfer that happens at death. It’s an ongoing process of preparation during your lifetime. Instead of keeping financial matters completely private, invite your children into age-appropriate conversations about your values, your goals, and the responsibilities they may inherit one day.
Think of it like teaching your child to drive. You wouldn’t simply hand over the keys without practice and guidance. Likewise, don’t hand over wealth without the training and perspective they need to manage it wisely.
Of course, perspective alone isn’t enough. Once you embrace this broader definition of wealth, you’ll need systems that ensure your financial assets are actually protected and available when the time comes.
# The Practical Side: Legal and Financial Strategies That Work
Too many people think, even those with substantial assets, that estate planning is about creating a set of documents. But documents aren’t enough. A document like a will, trust, power of attorney or healthcare directive, cannot pass on all that’s important to you, and it doesn’t address the direct impact on the people you love once you die or if you become incapacitated. The truth is, a document alone often creates more problems than it solves - like months of probate, thousands in legal fees, and painful family conflict during an already emotional time. 
That’s why my Life & Legacy Planning® process goes further. Protecting wealth and passing it on requires much more than a set of documents that eventually go stale over time. Protecting wealth requires so much more, such as:
**Comprehensive Asset Organization**
Your plan begins with a complete inventory of everything you own - bank accounts, investments, real estate, insurance policies, digital assets, business interests, and personal items of value. Each asset is titled correctly and integrated into your overall plan so nothing is lost or overlooked - and can be passed on to the people you love.
**A Plan That Stays Up to Date**
Life doesn’t stand still, and your plan shouldn’t either. Marriages, divorces, births, deaths, and property changes all require updates to ensure your plan continues to reflect your current life and wishes. Through regular reviews, I help ensure your plan stays current so it works exactly as intended when your family needs it most.
**Clarity for the People You Love**
A Life & Legacy Plan doesn’t just protect your assets—it protects the people you love from uncertainty. Your family receives clear guidance about what you own, how to find it, and what to do when the time comes. I help you document where accounts are held, how to access them, and who to contact for help. This clarity prevents the confusion and conflict that too often arise when families are left searching for answers.
**Ongoing Guidance and a Trusted Relationship**
Legal strategies form the foundation of wealth preservation, but they’re only one part of the equation. My role as your Personal Family Lawyer® is to serve as your trusted advisor for life - someone who understands your family, your values, and your goals, and who will be there to guide your loved ones when you no longer can. And if I’m not able to be there, I’ll have a trusted colleague you can turn to who will be there in the same way I would. That ongoing relationship ensures your plan works not just legally, but practically and emotionally, for the people you care about most.
Creating a comprehensive plan and keeping it updated over time is only one part of preserving generational wealth.  For true generational wealth to last, your children also need the tools, guidance, and values to use it wisely.
# The Education Piece: Preparing the Next Generation
Even the most thoughtfully crafted estate plan can’t prepare your family to carry your intentions forward. Real success requires education, communication, and participation, so the people you love understand not only what you decided, but why.
That’s why I encourage families to treat planning as an ongoing conversation, not a one-time event. When your family understands your decisions in advance, such as why you chose certain beneficiaries, appointed specific roles, or structured inheritances a particular way, they’re far less likely to experience confusion or conflict later. These conversations also provide a chance to share your values, priorities, and hopes for how your wealth will be used to strengthen relationships, not divide them.
If you are a member of my FamilyCare Program, I will facilitate family meetings where we review your plan together. In these meetings, we explain how your plan works, what responsibilities each person may hold. It also gives them the opportunity to ask questions while you’re here to answer them, preventing misunderstandings later. Having everyone in the same room, literally or virtually, builds understanding and unity, ensuring that your family has a clear roadmap and a trusted advisor they can turn to when the time comes.
When you work with me, you’ll also record a Life & Legacy Interview, where you'll share your stories, values, instructions for your loved ones, and your reasons for the choices you’ve made. Combined with periodic family meetings and regular plan updates, this approach ensures that your loved ones are never left wondering what you wanted, or why.
Ultimately, the goal isn’t just to pass on assets, but to create a foundation of trust, understanding, and continuity. When your family is informed and included, they’re empowered to honor your legacy with confidence and clarity.
When your children are educated and prepared, the next question becomes: how do you ensure that wealth doesn’t just last for them, but also for grandchildren and beyond?
# Thinking Beyond One Generation
The families who keep wealth for generations plan not just for children, but for grandchildren and great-grandchildren. This often means using structures designed for long-term stewardship:
Trusts that distribute assets over time, protecting against mismanagement or outside threats.
Family governance structures that bring relatives together for ongoing discussions about values and shared resources.
Family foundations that involve multiple generations in philanthropy, reinforcing shared purpose and connection.
The goal isn’t simply to pass down money. It’s to create a structure that helps your family stay connected, supported, and guided by the values that built the wealth in the first place.
With the right mindset, strategies, and education in place, the final step is taking action. Start today, while you have the time and clarity to shape your legacy.
