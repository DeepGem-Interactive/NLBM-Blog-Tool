Why It Matters to Your Loved Ones That You Work With the Right Lawyer
When someone you love dies, grief hits hard enough. But imagine adding legal chaos, confusing paperwork, and no one to guide you through it all. That's the reality for thousands of people every year who are left to navigate a confusing, messy, and expensive legal and financial process without support.
In this article, you'll read real stories of families who struggled through the legal and financial process alone, the challenges they faced, and why having the right lawyer, as a trusted advisor to you and your loved ones, makes all the difference for the people you love when they need it most. Let's start by looking at what actually happens when families are left to navigate the process on their own.
# Real Stories of Legal Chaos
The best way to understand why your loved ones need guidance when something happens to you is to see what happens when people  don't have good guidance. These are real stories about real people. They aren't hypothetical scenarios:
**Molly's Seven Handwritten Wills**
 thought writing down her wishes would be enough to pass on her assets the way she wanted. After her death, her family found seven different handwritten documents she wrote on her own. By the time an attorney was hired to sort out the mess these handwritten notes created, fourteen heirs were claiming rights to the estate. Twelve estranged family members suddenly appeared, and one intended beneficiary was ready to give up and split everything with relatives Molly barely knew. Perhaps Molly thought her situation was simple, and yet it turned out to be anything but that. We find that’s often the case. Many people say “oh, my situation is simple” and, yet, for the people you love, it can be anything but simple once you are gone.
**The Blended Family Betrayal**
 created "mirror image wills" leaving everything to each other, then equally to their five children from previous marriages. When Nancy died suddenly, all her assets went to Jack - who quickly executed a new will naming only his three biological children as beneficiaries of all the assets. Nancy's two children were forced to leave their mother's home and received nothing from their mother. Think it won’t happen in your family? If you are on a second or third marriage (or more) with children from a prior, your kids are at risk without great pre-planning and a post-death trusted advisor.

If you want to dive even deeper on this one, get the book Rest In Peace. Robbed In Probate.: The Story Behind a Widow’s $2 Billion Jury Verdict Against JPMorgan Chase Bank by Jo Hopper. Yes, stories like this happen everyday. If you have a blended family, let’s get your estate planning updated or handled so nothing like this happens to the people you love.
**Frank's 21 Heirs**
 built a successful family business with two nephews who were like sons to him. They were the only family members at his funeral. But because Frank died without a will, the law required that his estate be divided equally among *all* 21 of his nieces and nephews - including 19 people he hadn't seen in over 20 years. The two nephews who helped build his business and who were close to him got the same small fraction as relatives who'd been strangers to Frank. 
If you are building a family business, don’t leave the future to chance. Create it now by calling us and schedule a Life & Legacy PlanningⓇ Session so we can review your family dynamics and your assets, then create the right plan.
Stories like these highlight a simple truth: without the right lawyer who knows you, can anticipate conflict, and provide guidance to those you love, the process of transitioning assets after your death can be slow, expensive, and often heartbreaking. To truly understand how to protect your loved ones, let’s dig deeper into exactly why the process is so daunting.
# How People Struggle Without Legal Guidance
Without the right lawyer who already knows you and your family, your loved ones are left to figure everything out on their own. Here's what happens:
**Nobody knows what to do. **When you have no estate plan or an estate plan that fails when your loved ones need it because it’s just a set of documents in a drawer or on a shelf with little guidance or direction, the people you care about the most could  be forced to go to court for a process called probate (after your death) or guardianship/conservatorship (during your life), even if you have a will or power of attorney in place. 

Court requires navigating forms, deadlines, and formal hearings in front of a judge, which is confusing, complicated and has means following rules that may be obscure. People end up in a legal system they don't understand while experiencing the weight of grieving. It's like being dropped into a foreign country where you don't speak the language.
**It costs more than you think. **Probate fees, court costs, and attorneys' bills add up quickly. In many states lawyers can charge a percentage of the estate's gross value. For example, a $600,000 home - and no other assets - means potentially tens of thousands in legal fees. Even a modest estate can lose a fortune to the process. This is much more expensive than working with the right lawyer in the first place.
In addition, when you don’t already have a lawyer to turn to, your loved ones will need to find a lawyer who’s a stranger to you, and doesn’t know what was important to you. Your loved ones will have to pay that lawyer to review all relevant documents and talk to people who knew you. It’s like starting all over but also without first-hand knowledge.
**The process drags on and accounts are inaccessible. **Even simple matters can take months. Complicated ones take years. While you’re waiting for the process to unfold, your assets will be frozen, leaving your loved ones in financial limbo. During that time, they can't access the money they need or move forward with their lives.
And it’s not just their inheritance they won’t be able to access. If you have a mortgage on your home, loved ones will have to pay out of their own pockets (often with a mortgage of their own) to pay your mortgage to keep the bank from foreclosing. 
**Conflict explodes. **Grief and stress magnify small disagreements, turning them into costly battles that can destroy relationships. One heir might want to sell the family home immediately, while another wants to keep it. Without clear guidance, minor differences turn into major rifts. It happens all the time, even in families where conflict didn’t exist before.
**Assets get lost. **Think about this: Would your loved ones know how to find and access all your assets? Do they know where you bank and how many accounts you have? Would they know about your insurance policies or retirement accounts? If you receive benefits through an employer, would they know how to access that information? Do they know where your passwords are kept or how to unlock your phone or laptop? 
Most people haven’t considered these questions before, and what happens is an asset gets missed. And once assets are missed, they are turned over to the state’s Department of Unclaimed Property to sit there, unavailable for the people you love.
**Predators move in. **Probate files are public, which means scammers can target vulnerable heirs with fake claims or schemes. Without a lawyer protecting the family's interests, these threats can devastate what's left of the estate.
It's easy to think,* "My family will figure it out,"* but the truth is most families are blindsided by just how much is involved. Even tasks as simple as locating accounts, paying final bills, and filing court paperwork can feel impossible without someone to guide the way.
The good news is there's a better way. One that provides your family with the support, guidance, and protection they need.
# Our Personal Family LawyerⓇ Difference
As a Personal Family Lawyer, I don't just draft documents and disappear. I get to know you, your family, your assets, and your wishes. When you die, your loved ones won't be left scrambling for answers or searching for a lawyer who doesn't know you. They'll have someone who already understands what matters to you.
Here’s what this means for those you love most:
Clear, enforcable instructions so they aren’t left guessing what you wanted or how to make it happen.
Step-by-step guidance through the process so they can focus on healing, not paperwork and legal complexity.
Decreasing conflict by making sure everyone understands your wishes before disputes erupt.
Support when it matters most, from someone they already know and trust.
Think about the difference between showing up to a hospital emergency room where no one knows your history, versus seeing a doctor who has been with you for years. The first experience is stressful and full of uncertainty. The second is calmer, because someone who already knows your background can act quickly and confidently. That's what working with me is like for your loved ones after you're gone.
This relationship is what makes life so much easier for all the people you love.
# A Plan That Works With a Relationship to Support It
My Life & Legacy Planningprocess is what makes all this possible. Unlike traditional estate planning that focuses only on documents, Life & Legacy Planning is a comprehensive approach that only Personal Family Lawyers like me offer. It’s an entire system that ensures your plan actually works when your family needs it. 
When you work with a traditional lawyer, you get documents, you sign them, and that's the end of the relationship. But documents alone don't prevent court, family disputes, or lost assets.
When you work with me, on the other hand, you’ll create a Life & Legacy Plan that goes further. It includes:
A complete inventory of your assets, so nothing is overlooked or lost when you're gone.
Regular reviews to update your plan as your life and laws change over time.
Clear guidance for your loved ones on what to do first and how to handle everything step by step.
A trusted lawyer who will be there for them when you can't be.
When you work with the right lawyer, planning isn't about paperwork. It's about creating a roadmap for your loved ones and giving them a guide they already know and trust. It's about keeping them out of court and conflict while preserving not just your assets but your values and wishes for the next generation. It’s about making things as easy as possible for them so they have space to grieve. And it’s about peace of mind for you, knowing you’ve done all you can for everyone you love.
Which future do you want for the people you love? Sailing through the legal and financial process with confidence or drowning in confusion while they're trying to grieve?
