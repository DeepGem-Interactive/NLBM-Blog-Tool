Don’t Lose Your Family Stories: How to Preserve Your Legacy Before It’s Too Late
A client once told me she would give anything to hear her grandmother’s voice again. Her grandmother had been the heart of the family—the one who told stories about how she survived the Great Depression and how she fell in love with her husband. But when she passed away, those stories went with her. They had never been written down or recorded, and now an entire chapter of the family’s history was gone forever.
Every day, families lose stories like these. Recipes, traditions, lessons, and memories vanish when the storytellers are no longer here. But you don’t have to let that happen in your family. You can capture these irreplaceable pieces of history and ensure they live on as part of something greater—a legacy that guides, inspires, and connects future generations.
In this article, you’ll discover why family stories are the foundation of a lasting legacy, how to preserve them in ways your family will treasure, and how my Life & Legacy Planning® process ensures that your family’s stories will be preserved.
# Why Family Stories Are the Heart of Your Legacy
Stories aren’t just entertainment at the holiday table. They’re how families pass on values, resilience, and identity. Without intentional preservation, even the most powerful stories can vanish within a generation.
Think of your great-grandmother’s courage when she immigrated to a new country. That wasn’t just her story—it set a pattern of strength that still echoes in your family today. Or picture your grandparents meeting during wartime—not just a romantic tale, but proof that joy can be found even in uncertain times.
These aren’t just memories. They are blueprints. They show your children and grandchildren how to face adversity, how to love, and how to persevere.
When you preserve family stories, you’re doing far more than keeping people entertained. You’re creating a framework of identity and values that will outlast you. You’re showing future generations not just what your family owned, but who your family is.
And here’s something many people overlook: **your family stories make your estate plan more meaningful. **When your children know why education mattered to their ancestors, they’ll understand why you’ve structured their inheritance to support learning. When they hear how the family business was built from nothing, they’ll respect the responsibility of carrying it forward.
Families that know their stories are almost always the ones with stronger bonds across generations. They aren’t just connected by blood—they’re connected by shared identity.
So how do you make sure those stories don’t slip away? That’s where intentional preservation—and my process—comes in.
# Preserving Stories for the Next Generations 
The challenge isn’t just capturing family stories—it’s making sure future generations actually use and treasure them. Too many well-intentioned projects end up as forgotten albums on a shelf or files no one ever opens.
That’s why, when you create a Life & Legacy Plan with me, we don’t leave this up to chance. This isn’t a “someday project” that you’ll put on a to-do list and never get around to. It’s built right into your plan as a Life & Legacy Interview.
During your Life & Legacy Interview, we’ll record your stories, values, and wisdom, so your loved ones hear your voice, your laughter, and your lessons in your own words. This way, your family’s most meaningful stories are not only captured but preserved. Many clients have told me that the Interview was the most meaningful part of the planning process, and that they never would have done it without my support.
But don’t think of your Interview as a one-time project. If you’re a member of my FamilyCare Program, we will record new interviews every year so you have a growing library of stories to pass on to your loved ones.
But even with a Life & Legacy Interview built into your plan, you may want to capture even more stories on your own. The best way to start is by asking the right questions.
# Questions That Unlock the Stories Your Family Needs
The best stories don’t come from surface-level questions. They come from questions that dig into emotions, lessons, and values.
For example, instead of asking “What was your childhood like?” try: “What’s a memory from your childhood that still guides your decisions today?”
Questions about relationships reveal powerful insights:
“Tell me about someone who influenced your life without realizing it.”
“What did you learn about love from watching your parents?”
Don’t be afraid to ask about hard times—but frame them in terms of growth:
“Tell me about a time the family had to pull together to get through something.”
“What challenge made us stronger?”
Questions about values give future generations a moral compass:
“What decision are you proud of, and what guided you in making it?”
“If you could pass on three life lessons, what would they be?”
And sometimes the most revealing stories come from ordinary moments:
“What did a typical Sunday look like in your home?”
“What little traditions made your family feel like family?”
Finally, ask forward-looking questions:
“What do you want future generations to remember about you?”
“What should our family always stand for?”
The magic of the Life & Legacy Planning process with our Life & Legacy Interview built in is that I’ll ask questions like these for you, capture it all, and ensure none of it is lost—so you don’t have to worry about forgetting what to ask, missing the important moments, or losing any of it.. 
Once these stories are captured, the question becomes: how do you make sure they actually shape your family’s future? That’s where my Life & Legacy Planning process comes in.
# Building a Legacy That Lasts Beyond Bank Accounts
When most people think of estate planning, they think of documents that move money and property from one generation to the next. **But here’s the truth: money without meaning rarely lasts.**
The families who thrive across generations aren’t the ones with the biggest bank accounts. They’re the ones with clear values, shared identity, and stories that remind them of who they are.
That’s why Life & Legacy Planning goes beyond documents. We won’t just make sure your assets are transferred properly. We make sure the **why** behind your plan—your love, your wisdom, your family legacy—is passed on too. This creates an anchor of love and guidance that your children and grandchildren can return to long after you’re gone.
Your children and grandchildren can see not just the money you left, but the principles you lived by. They’ll know why you set up the structures you did, and they’ll feel the love behind them.
And here’s something else:** families that preserve their stories often avoid the conflicts that tear others apart. **When everyone understands the family values and the reasons behind decisions, there’s less room for resentment and fighting.
But you can only create that kind of plan while the storytellers are still here. Every day you wait is another day a story might be lost forever. That’s why it’s important to start now, with a Life & Legacy Plan designed to pass on both your assets and your stories.
